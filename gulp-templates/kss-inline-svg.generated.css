    DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE

    It is generated by the "gulp svg" task.

    The css file provides all generated inline svg in one file which is included in the kss styleguide.
    This enables you to display graphics in the styleguide even if they are not included in main.css.
    In main.css the svg will only be available if you actually use/include them by "extend %svg-yourgraphic;".
    This prevents you from including svg in you styles, which are not in use.
